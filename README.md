Welcome to the Car Rental Website project! This system is designed to provide a realistic and functional car rental experience. It includes features for both administrators and customers, along with various security measures and efficient query functionality.

## Goals

Design a car rental system thatâ€™s realistic and can be used. 

## Validations

- Customers must be over 18 years.
- Customers must enter a valid national ID and license number.
- Password must be at least 8 characters.
- No more than one account can be created for the same person (national ID, license number, and email must be unique).
- Rent dates must be valid (Customers can't rent a car on previous dates).

## Features

### Admin

- View all daily payments (or choose a specific range of dates).
- View all customer information (except for the password).
- Insert a new office.
- View all offices.
- Insert a new car to a specific office.
- Update a car if it's out of service.
- View all cars.
- View reservations:
  - Can search by any of the customerâ€™s information (name, email, national ID, etc.).
  - Can search by any of the carâ€™s information (type, model, year, etc.).
  - Can search by reservation information (start date, end date, payment done or not).

- First, the customer should register and then log in.
- They will be directed to the home page where they can search for any car according to their needs.
- They must enter the following:
  - Start and end date of reservation.
  - Country.
- Theyâ€™ll also have the following as optional:
  - Min, max price.
  - Carâ€™s type, model, model year.
- After renting a car, they can go to the payment page having 2 options:
  - Rent.
  - Cancel reservation.
- Finally, a customer can view all of their reservations.

## Security

No one can access or see the admin section except the admin when he enters his email and password in the login.

## Queries

All queries are designed efficiently to get all the correct data for admin or customers and are dynamic for the advanced search the system provides. In other words, thereâ€™s only one query to retrieve the data works for entering (carâ€™s specs, customerâ€™s information, etc.) or leaving these boxes empty.
